                My first Macbook Pro with Retina display
            </p>

            <h3>1 year ago, I bought my FIRST Macbook at quite good price. Because, my university provided AOC on Apple Store. AOC means Apple on Campus which offers special education pricing on Apple computers, software and third part products to college students.</h3>

            <h3>Actually, I’m majoring in Computer Science. and I’d like to be a developer who make the most great game in the world. So, I needed a computer which has good performance.</h3>

            <h3>One of my friends strongly recommended me Macbook. he told me that Macbook has nice performance for developing because it has various software which another operating system doesn’t have and is optimized on developing.</h3>

            <h3>When I opened the package, I couldn’t help being surprised because of super-clean, super-organized package. In white package box, there were only Macbook, charger and small guidebook. That was all, but perfect.</h3>

            <h3>I was tempted of goreous groundbreaking Retina display which has so many pixels over 4 million on the 13-inch model. The pixel density is so high, my eyes can’t discern individual pixels. and high 2560-by-1600 resolution help me work well.</h3>

            <img src="image/IMG_06.JPG">
            <h3>Amazingly, 13-inch Macbook Pro with Retina display has fifth-generation dual-core Intel Core i5, so I can take my most performance-hungry apps on the road such as Unity, Parallels. and Hyper-Threading technology is also included in this model..</h3>


            <img src="image/IMG_07.JPG">
            <h3>Another thing impressive is the new Force Touch trackpad. it can take all the capabilities of Multi-Touch and detect subtle differences in the amount of downward pressure I apply. After using this, I decided not to use mouse any longer. It was a kind of revolution for me.</h3>


            <img src="image/IMG_09.JPG">
            <h3>It is really fast and versatile. Especially, Thunderbolt 2 provides up to 20Gb/s of bandwidth to each external device. So, I can use high-performance peripherals and displays with my Macbook. It helps my work more effective. and I can connect massive amounts of storage, so I don’t need to be worried about storage problem any more.</h3>

            <h3>Macbook Pro is designed to go anywhere. Even though my roommate go to sleep and turn off all of lights, I can use Macbook! Because it has beautiful light keyboard which display brightness automatically.</h3>
